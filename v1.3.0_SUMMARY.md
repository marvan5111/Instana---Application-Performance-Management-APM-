# v1.3.0 Release Summary: Instana APM Synthetic Monitoring Dashboard

## Overview
This release transforms the project from synthetic data generation to a full-stack operational intelligence platform with live dashboards, alerting, and production deployment capabilities.

## Key Features Delivered
- **Live Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of website, mobile, and synthetic performance metrics using Dash, Plotly, and Pandas.
- **Proactive Alerting System**: Automated Slack and email notifications for performance degradation based on configurable thresholds.
- **Advanced Synthetic Flows**: Simulation of multi-step user journeys (login → search → checkout) to validate critical business transactions.
- **Secure & Deployable**: Application secured with authentication and configured for production deployment on Heroku, Azure, or AWS.
- **Mobile Monitoring**: Crash rate, response time, battery/memory usage tracking for iOS/Android apps.
- **Logging Analysis**: Timeline visualization, severity filtering, and correlation with performance metrics.

## Technical Implementation
- **Dashboard Tabs**:
  - Overview: KPI cards, comparison charts, alert summary, system health gauges.
  - Website Monitoring: Uptime and response time charts.
  - Mobile Monitoring: Crash rate, response time, battery/memory charts.
  - Synthetic Checks: Pass/fail counts, error rate thresholds.
  - Logging Analysis: Log timeline, correlation scatter plot, severity filter.
- **Data Sources**: JSONL files for website, mobile, synthetic, and log data.
- **Authentication**: Basic auth using dash-auth with environment variables.
- **Alerting**: Configurable thresholds in alerting.py, Slack webhook integration.
- **Deployment**: Procfile for Heroku, requirements.txt with all dependencies.

## Testing Results
