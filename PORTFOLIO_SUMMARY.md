 # Project: End-to-End APM Monitoring Dashboard
 
 **[Live Demo Link]** | **[GitHub Repository Link]**
 
 ## Overview
 
 Developed a full-stack operational intelligence platform that ingests, analyzes, and visualizes synthetic and real-user monitoring data. The project demonstrates a complete development lifecycle, from backend data generation to a secure, deployed, and interactive web application.
 
 ## Key Achievements & Technical Skills:
 
 - **Full-Stack Development**: Built a multi-tab monitoring dashboard using **Python**, **Plotly Dash**, and **Pandas** for data manipulation.
 - **Backend Systems**: Engineered a suite of 16+ synthetic data generators to mimic real-world APM data streams for websites, mobile apps, and synthetic checks.
 - **CI/CD & Deployment**: Configured the application for production deployment using **Gunicorn**, with detailed guides for **Heroku**, **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**, and **Azure App Service**. Implemented environment variable management for secure configuration.
 - **Authentication & Security**: Secured the dashboard using `dash-auth` for role-based access control.
 - **Automated Alerting**: Designed and implemented a threshold-based alerting system that sends proactive notifications via Slack and email to identify performance degradation.
 - **Data Validation**: Created a comprehensive validation suite (`validate_all.py`) to ensure end-to-end data integrity and cross-file consistency.
