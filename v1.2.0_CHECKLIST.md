# v1.2.0 Coverage Checklist

This checklist tracks progress on v1.2.0 priorities: website monitoring, mobile monitoring, logging, and synthetic checks.

## 1. Website Monitoring
**Goal:** Add synthetic website monitoring configurations, catalogs, metrics, and analyze snapshots to cover Instana's website monitoring APIs.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] `website_config.jsonl`: Valid website configurations with realistic URLs and settings
- [x] `website_catalog.jsonl`: Catalog of websites with metadata
- [x] `website_metrics.jsonl`: Time-series metrics for websites
- [x] `website_analyze.jsonl`: Analysis snapshots with traces and issues
- [x] All files pass validation and cross-file consistency

**Effort:** Medium (1–2 weeks)

## 2. Mobile Monitoring
**Goal:** Add synthetic mobile app monitoring configurations, catalogs, metrics, and analyze snapshots.

**Details:**
- Generate mobile app configurations: synthetic app definitions with platforms, versions, and thresholds
- Create mobile catalogs: lists of monitored apps with metadata
- Produce mobile metrics: synthetic performance metrics (crash rates, response times, user sessions)
- Simulate mobile analyze snapshots: detailed analysis with crash reports and traces

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `mobile_config.jsonl`: Valid mobile app configurations
- [ ] `mobile_catalog.jsonl`: Catalog of mobile apps
- [ ] `mobile_metrics.jsonl`: Time-series metrics for mobile apps
- [ ] `mobile_analyze.jsonl`: Analysis snapshots with crash data
- [ ] All files pass validation and cross-file consistency

**Effort:** Medium (1–2 weeks)

## 3. Logging
**Goal:** Add synthetic logging analyze data with entries, severity levels, and correlation to issues.

**Details:**
- Generate log entries: synthetic logs with timestamps, severity, messages, and tags
- Include correlation IDs linking logs to traces and issues
- Support different log sources (applications, infrastructure)
- Ensure temporal consistency with other datasets

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] `logs.jsonl`: Valid log entries with realistic content
- [x] Logs correlate with existing issues and traces where applicable
- [x] Validation checks for temporal and referential integrity

**Effort:** Medium (1–2 weeks)

## 4. Synthetic Monitoring (Synthetic Checks)
**Goal:** Add synthetic monitoring checks and run results linked to endpoints.

**Details:**
- Generate synthetic check definitions: API and browser checks with configurations
- Create check run results: synthetic outcomes with response times, success/failure status
- Link checks to endpoints (e.g., check for "POST /checkout")
- Include alert correlations for failed checks

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] `synthetic_checks.jsonl`: Check definitions
- [x] `synthetic_runs.jsonl`: Run results with timestamps and outcomes
- [x] Checks reference valid endpoints
- [x] Validation ensures realistic failure patterns

**Effort:** Medium (1–2 weeks)

## Overall v1.2.0 Release Criteria
- [x] All four features implemented and validated
- [x] Comprehensive validation script updated to include new datasets
- [x] Cross-file consistency checks for all new files
- [x] README_INSTANA.md updated with v1.2.0 highlights
- [x] GitHub release v1.2.0-instana-synthetic published with validation log
